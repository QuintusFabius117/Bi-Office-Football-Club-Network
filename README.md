# Bi-Office-Football-Club-Network

University assignment requiring the creation of a network for a football club that has an office in Cheltenham and a Stadium in London

# Assignment Brief

### Overview

A high-profile football club is upgrading its digital infrastructure to support the demands of a modern Smart Stadium in London and a Training & Youth Centre in Cheltenham. Both sites suffer from outdated networks, minimal segmentation, and increasing exposure to cyber threats.

Departments such as IT, Ticketing, Media, Retail, Medical, and Coaching rely on uninterrupted, secure connectivity for daily operations. Match days introduce massive load surges with over 50,000 fans, thousands of devices, and high-demand public Wi-Fi use. 

### Staffing Per Dept.

IT Department: 25 staff (system admins, network engineers, cybersecurity specialists).
Ticketing & Fan Services: 140 staff (sales, access control, customer support).
Media & Communications: 30 staff (social media, live streaming).
Retail: 220 staff (e-commerce, in-stadium retail operations).
Medical: 6 staff (doctors, physios).
Coaching & Performance: 35 staff (coaches, data analysts, training staff).
